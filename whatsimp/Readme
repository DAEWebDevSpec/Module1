####What's important

What's important to each individual can often 
overlap. Family, Health, and Money,are some of the 
most popular choices that are almost universally 
ranked near the top. Personally of course I'd 
include these but I'd add a few more concepts.

1. Mindset and Mental Makeup
2. Coachability
3. Adaptability
4. Versatility
