#### What's important

What's important to each individual can often 
overlap. Family:family:, Health:hearts:, and Money:heavy_dollar_sign:,are some of the 
most popular choices that are almost universally 
ranked near the top. Personally of course I'd 
include these but I'd add a few more concepts.

1. Mindset and Mental Makeup
2. Coachability
3. Adaptability
4. Perseverance

Or in otherwords... the Mamba Mentality!!
