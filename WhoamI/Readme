## _Who am I_
 Who am I is such a loaded question that has been 
asked by

man since the beginning of time. Over my 31 years of

existence on this planet, I've live many different 
walks of

life, I've traveled to many places and met many 
different

people. To this day I feel like my identity is still   
being formed.


The reality of it is I'm still not sure who I am I 
have been

* a cook

* an athlete

* a student

* a college dropout

* a soldier

* a sales rep

* a forklift driver

* a follower

* a leader

* a podcaster

* a painter

* an actor

* a teacher

* a programmer

So who I am is deeper than my current title or 
occupation it's extremely difficult to limit such a 
question to a 60 second response.
