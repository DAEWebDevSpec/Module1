## _Who am I_

Who am I is such a loaded question that has been asked by

man since the beginning of time. Over my 31 years of

existence on this planet, I've live many different walks of

life, I've traveled to many places and met many different

people. To this day I feel like my identity is still

being formed.

So who I am is deeper than my current title or

occupation it's extremely difficult to limit such a 

question to a 60 second response.
