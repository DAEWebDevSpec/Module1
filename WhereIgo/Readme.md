>"You can never forget where you from, no matter how far you go."

Wise words from a little known 20th/21st century Philosopher Nasir bin Olu
Dara Jones :laughing:

I think when speaking on the future and direction one is heading,

relativity, being as vital as it is to everything in the universe, there

literally is no way to determine a direction without finding one's start

point. Growing up in New Haven wasn't always the easiest. Coming from a single mother

home didn't make it any easier, what it did was plant a seed. As I grew that seed grew into a desire to build and give back to my community.
