This directory contains my module 1 project, 
it includes five folders answering questions from;

Who I am
Some things I know
Where I'm going
WHat's Important to me
What's possible

The purpose of this directory is to show I can navigate and create directories/folders through the terminal.
It is also important that I can create, edit and delete files using the terminal. I will include various files to answer these questions to a fuller extent.
