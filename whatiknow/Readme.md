### I KNOW ALL

This question is the easiest one to answer believe 

it or not. I know everything! Any question I may have I can just Google it age of 

information baby! I do have a peculiar knack for retaining 

random tidbits of imformation though in all seriousness. Like for instance the 

heartbeat of a pygmy shrew is 1200 bpm and is 

actually the fastest among the mammal family. I'm 

al;so a poor man's history buff so a lot of my 

random facts revolve around wars like the fact that 

WWI was actually started due to the assasination of 

Austrian Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand. I consider 

myself somewhat of a novice scientist so I'm very 

interested in physics and the rules of the working 

world and universe around me. I can talk about space 

and black holes for hours.  Sports ar high on my 


interest meter I am a poor man's sports historian 

when it comes to the NBA and the NFL. I am an 

amateur java coder, and I can speak a little 

Italian, and Spanish.
