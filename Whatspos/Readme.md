## What's possible?

<ins>**Great Question!**</ins>

With the progress the human race has made just in the last 20-30 years alone,

I don't believe anyone should rule out anything being possible. 

Predicting the future of technology or the future in general has always been a hit or miss endeavor.:hourglass_flowing_sand:

AI:computer:, Cybernetics, Satelites that can view further than any before:satellite:, Microchips the size of pin tips,

neurolink brain inserts with the potential to cure blindness are just a few of the amazing advances some of the leaders

of industry are breaching. Tomorrow that could include Lightspeed travel:rocket: and lightsabers for all we know. 

Coming from oil lanterns and horse and buggy less than 150 years ago we might literally be teleporting this time next week.

Thomas Edison famous for the invention of the lightbulb after reportedly 10,000 attempts at it failed, Was quoted saying 

>"When you have exhausted all possibilities remember this: you Haven't".

I've attempted to view the world with a scientific eye and that mandates that no matter what you know, or you think you know,

tomorrow someone could make a discovery that changes everything we know about how we _think_ the universe works.

So based on that idea alone it's not only against my worldview to say anything is Impossible,

but it's also almost always going to be proven wrong shortly thereafter.
